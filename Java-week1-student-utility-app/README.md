- Add two integers
- Check if a number is EVEN or ODD (using a ternary operator)
- Print numbers from 1 to N (using a for loop)
- Display the day of the week from a number (1–7) using a switch statement

## How to Run
From a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```bash
cd Java-week1-student-utility-app/src
javac JavaStudentUtilityClass.java
